# KubeCraft Sales Script

---

## The 4 Beliefs

1. We are the best in the world at what we do.
2. People truly want and need what we offer.
3. I'm doing them a favor by providing a solution to their problem.
4. If they say "No" then it's their loss.

---

## Pre-Call Checklist

- [ ] Have a pen and notepad in front of you
- [ ] Turn all devices on "Do Not Disturb" and close all browsers
- [ ] Release all attachments to the sale or to "YES" (if you "need" the sale you will not get it)
- [ ] Dial / Start Zoom the very minute the clock hits

---

## The 3 Rules of Sales

1. Your only job is to help the prospect make the best decision for them.
2. What's best for them is typically outside their comfort zone.
3. People will fight like hell to stay in their comfort zone.

> Remember, a doctor doesn't sit down with a new patient and just answer questions about the various drugs and prescriptions they have available. They have to diagnose what is needed, and then they can offer what will be the best decision for them.
>
> This is the exact same process here. No sense starting out the call answering questions from the prospect about the options to work with you without knowing what they need / are looking for AND qualified for.

**"Shoes that don't fit are not a bargain at any price."**

---

## No-Show Protocol

If somebody doesn't show up, give them a ring and say:

> "Hey [NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] from KubeCraft. I just wanted to let you know I am going to be about 5 to 10 minutes late because I am still with another member, so you are not sitting around waiting for me. Is it okay if I jump on in about 5 to 10 minutes and I will see you on the call?"

---

## PART 1: Open

> "Hey NAME, nice to meet you, I'm NAME with KubeCraft."

**⚠️ RAPPORT SHOULD NOT EXTEND PAST THE 2 MINUTE MARK**

---

## PART 2: Set the Agenda

> "Let's do this… Just so we're on the same page, I wanna give you a quick overview of this call. What I'll do is just ask some questions about what you're currently doing, what you're looking for and if we help you get there. If what we do is a great fit to help you then I'm happy to tell you how that works. If I believe KubeCraft is a fit for you then I will show you our next steps.
>
> But, here's the thing, if at any point I feel like this isn't a good fit for you. No worries, I'll let you know and then point you in a different direction. Just whatever makes sense for you!
>
> Does that sound good?"

*(Wait for an "okay" or "awesome" then move forward)*

> "Do you have a pen and pad or something you can use to take notes?"

---

## PART 3: Understand Why They're Here

> "Awesome… So give me some context, what's the main thing that motivated you to book this call?"

### Optional Follow-ups (use if answer is short and vague)

- "What do you mean by that…?"
- "What caused this situation to happen?"
- "Tell me more about that…?"
- "How long have you been dealing with this…?"

**⚠️ THE GOAL IS FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING – Don't move on until you understand the problem**

*(If there is no need, then there's no need for a call)*

---

## PART 4: Examine Their Pain/Problem

Understand the main reasons they have for working with us (what problems do they have that this offer solves). This is simply asking more questions to understand what's causing their problem.

### Questions to Ask

**Current Situation:**
- What's your current role?
- What are you doing for work?
- How long have you been there?

**Motivation:**
- Why are you wanting to pursue a DevOps role?
- How long have you been feeling like it's time to transition?
- Why now? Did anything happen recently that motivated you to make a change now?

**Job Search Status:**
- Have you already applied to jobs?
  - **YES →** How did that go? Why do you think you didn't hear back? How many applications have you sent?
  - **NO →** Why not? Do you not feel ready? What has held you back from applying?

**Previous Attempts:**
- Have you taken any steps to try and transition into a new role already?
  - What have you tried?
  - How did it go / How did that work / Why do you think that didn't work?
  - How long have you been trying that?

**Family Situation:**
- How does your spouse / family feel about you making a career change?
- Does she know you are making this decision or does she make this decision for you?
  - **Alone →** Full steam ahead.
  - **Wife →** Ask to bring her in

**Technical Baseline (Scale of 1-10):**
- Linux
- Containers
- Kubernetes

*⚠️ ONE OR MORE WILL SCORE LOW. SAVE THIS AND TIE IT TO THEIR CURRENT SITUATION. WE PROVIDE THE SOLUTION TO MAKING THESE ALL 10/10s*

---

## PART 5: What They Want

> "Okay, great. Thanks for all the details… So what would you say is the end goal for you in the next 6-12 months?"

### Questions to Ask

- What kind of role would you be looking to get into?
  - Why that specifically?
- What would be the ideal income level?
  - Why that specifically?
- How soon would you want to transition to a new DevOps role?
- How would your life look differently if you got into that role?
- What does that do for you?

---

## PART 6: Identify the Blocker

> "What's holding you back from achieving XYZ (what they said they wanted)?"

### Summarize and Confirm

1. Summarize their pain
2. Summarize their dream
3. Put it together so it's clear to both of you

*Repeat things back to them and make sure you get it right*

**Example:**
> "Okay, so you don't want to waste anymore time trying to achieve XYZ [Land a job, upskill, promotion] on your own, and your goal is to [Make more money/Their dream], right?"

**Example:**
> "So what I'm hearing is — you've got the drive, but you're missing a proven system, feedback from experts, and a real community that keeps you accountable. Is that fair?"

---

## PART 7: Acknowledge The Gap (NOW TIE-DOWN)

> "Ok so I really just have one more question for you…
>
> Here's the thing: you're a great fit for us. We help clients every day do exactly what you're wanting to do. It seems like where you currently are just isn't going to get you where you want to go and you're ready to make a change.
>
> Which again, this is exactly what we help people do. But what I can tell you is that we are going to challenge you, we're going to hold you accountable and help you work through this process. Which I'm assuming you're open to, right?
>
> Good, so my last question is really just this:
>
> **Is this a 'NOW' thing for you? Like are you ready and willing to get help on making that change now?**"

### Alternative Phrasings

- "If we can help you solve these problems, are you ready to get started working on that now?"
- "If we can take you to 'the promise land', are you ready to get to work on that now?"

### Handling Non-YES Responses

**⚠️ Anything other than "YES" = pause and clarify**

**Example objection:** "Well I'm already working on these problems"

> "Well yeah you're trying to solve these problems, but obviously it hasn't worked because… that's why we're on this call right now. Which is why I'm asking if you're ready to get help now so those problems can ACTUALLY get solved."

**Example objection:** "I don't know because I don't know what you offer / how much it costs"

> "Well yeah because I haven't told you yet. I can break all of that down for you but honestly it won't matter if I give you a specific plan for how we'll solve these problems if it's not something you're ready to work on right now. That's why I'm asking, is this a 'NOW' thing? If I break down how we'll help and it makes sense for you, are you ready to work on that now?"

**⚠️ Again, anything other than "YES" is a red flag. If they can't say yes to this they won't be closing.**

---

## PART 8: Pre-Pitch

> "Awesome, well here's the thing. Our specialty is truly helping people in the exact situation you're in get [A DEVOPS JOB / GOAL OUTCOME].
>
> So the way we do that is by taking you through KubeCraft OS: a process that ensures you get XYZ (insert what they said they wanted).
>
> Now we can go one of two ways here, like I said this is a great fit for us so I can either break down step by step process for you OR if you have questions you're dying to ask we can hit those too. Where do you want to go from here?"

*They will either say "YES tell me how you work" or if they ask a question, the answer will segway you into telling them the offer*

---

## PART 9: The Pitch — The KubeCraft OS

### Opening

> "Alright, so here's how we help our members land real DevOps jobs.
>
> What I'm about to show you isn't a set of random courses — it's a complete, connected system called KubeCraft OS.
>
> Think of it as an operating system for your career.
>
> Every part installs a new layer of skills, proof, visibility, and confidence until interviews, hires and promotions become inevitable."

---

### 1️⃣ DevOps OS — Build the Core Skills

> "It starts with DevOps OS.
>
> This installs hands-on Linux, automation, containers, Cloud and Kubernetes at a deep level, in the same order real companies use in production. Even at enterprise level.
>
> So instead of bouncing between tutorials or guessing what to learn next, you follow one clear roadmap. The amazing part is Mischa's way of teaching is entirely hands-on and it is as if he's sitting right next to you and you're building things together. Just like having a mentor in real life next to you and you're building together.
>
> You always know exactly what to do, in what order, and why companies care about it. That way, every hour you invest actually moves you closer to your first DevOps role. You won't just learn DevOps, you will learn how to be able to do the work companies expect from you and you'll be able to prove it with ease once you're done.
>
> Does that make sense?"

---

### 2️⃣ HomeLab OS — Turn Skills Into Real-World Proof

> "Once you've built your foundation, HomeLab OS turns that knowledge into proof.
>
> You'll build the only multi-layer, enterprise-grade Kubernetes homelab on the internet — designed to mirror the exact kind of infrastructure used in production environments at companies. And the best part, you run this from home on an old laptop or a raspberry pi. It's your real environment to setup, break things and repair them. It's a portfolio piece on your Github that has landed most people inside KubeCraft jobs.
>
> By following our guided projects you demonstrate the same experience hiring managers and recruiters look for. You won't just watch and theorize, you build.
>
> This gives you the hands-on experience every job posting demands. This turns empty words to verifiable proof. And that matters more than anything today.
>
> Make sense?"

---

### 3️⃣ JobMagnet OS — Attract the Opportunities

> "JobMagnet OS turns your presence into a magnet for recruiters and job opportunities. More than 90% of our members land jobs by making them come to them - not the other way around.
>
> In just a few hours you can install our templates that took hundreds of hours to put together. You'll get our plug-and-play LinkedIn and personal branding system, skyrocketing your exposure. You'll get a professional profile from us, learn how to share your work authentically, and start attracting inbound messages — instead of sending hundreds of applications that lead to nowhere. All in less than 10 minutes per day. The change people see with this is huge and often even overnight.
>
> This system positions you as the engineer companies want to talk to.
>
> Sounds good?"

---

### 4️⃣ Focus OS — Maintain Consistency and Speed

> "Now, we both know time is our most precious resource. That's where Focus OS comes in.
>
> It helps you regain clarity, eliminate distractions, and learn up to 72% faster using our focus framework and proven note taking and goal setting system. It's what keeps members showing up, progressing, and finishing what they start — even with busy schedules. You won't find this anywhere else and it's been Mischa's secret weapon all the way through his career, but now it's yours too."

---

### 5️⃣ Interview OS — Turn Proof Into Offers

> "Finally, Interview OS ensures all that effort pays off.
>
> Here, we train you to speak with confidence, walk through your Homelab and projects, and communicate your value clearly in interviews. You'll know in detail how interview will go and what to say when - you'll go from fear and imposter syndrome to confidence and excitement.
>
> You'll practice with real questions, get feedback, and learn how to stand out as the obvious hire — not just another applicant.
>
> So instead of hoping to get lucky, you'll know exactly how to turn interviews into offers."

---

### Summary

> "That's the full KubeCraft OS — five interconnected systems that cover every part of the DevOps journey: skills, proof, visibility, consistency, and actually landing the opportunities you deserve.
>
> When you follow them in order, results aren't random — they're inevitable and get people hired all the time in KubeCraft, about 3 per week.
>
> Make sense?"

---

### Social Proof

> "And the best example here is Lennard." *(Show POST Win Lennard)*
>
> "Makes sense? So that's the whole system — those parts work together to make sure you don't just learn DevOps, but actually land the job.
>
> Now let me quickly show you how it all looks inside." *(share screen)*

---

### Show the Platform

**Community Tab:**
> "This is the Community. This is where you meet 800+ other engineers who are on the same journey as you. People below your level, at your level but most importantly, packed with seniors and expert mentors that will bring you to that next level.
>
> People post their projects, wins, and progress here every day. It's active 24/7, so you are never stuck. 100% of questions have been answered in the past 2 years.
>
> So when you see others landing jobs, it keeps you motivated."

**Classroom Tab:**
> "This is the Classroom. Here you'll find everything step-by-step — all the DevOps systems you can just open and start go through from A-Z, all the content, structure and templates in one place. It's built so you don't have to guess what to do next.
>
> You just log in, go through the videos, follow the roadmap, and build your portfolio as you go with the [DESIRED OUTCOME] at the end."

**Calendar Tab:**
> "Then here's the Calendar. This is where you can join live calls, Q&As, project reviews, and interview practice sessions.
>
> If you get stuck, you just show up to a call and get real-time help from a Microsoft MVP, freelancer and expert DevOps mentor that landed hundreds of people jobs."

## PART 10: Shut Up

**⚠️ When you're done communicating the pillars of your offer, STOP TALKING.**

We need them to ask questions or point us to what topic they want more info about.

### Common Questions They'll Ask

- "That all makes sense, but how does it work?"
- "How do you work with clients so they get these problems fixed?"
- "What does support look like?"
- "Is this 1:1 or group?"

**WE ONLY WANT TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS / TALK ABOUT WHAT MATTERS MOST TO THEM**

When their questions are answered / nowhere else to go in the call:

> "Well where do you want to go from here?"

*They will usually ask for the investment. (INVESTMENT NOT COST/PRICE)*

---

## PART 11: Temp Check

**⚠️ ALWAYS GET A TEMP CHECK BEFORE DISCUSSING INVESTMENT**

> "Ok sure, but before we discuss the investment let's do a quick gut check first…
>
> How are you feeling about everything? Do you feel like it's exactly what you need right now?"

> "Scale of 1-10… 1 being I never want to speak to this guy again (light hearted humor) and 10 being this will solve all my problems I wish I found you years ago… Where are you at?"

**⚠️ Do not move forward until you get a number**

### Handling the Number

- **Below 8/10:** "Most give this a 9 or higher, what makes you give it an X?"
- **8/10 or higher:** "What would be needed to make this a 10 for you?"

*This uncovers final objections*

> "Investment aside, how do you feel about the process? Do you feel like this will solve XYZ [Pain] and get you XYZ [Dream outcome]?"

**The point of a temp check is to get BUY-IN that this is what they want and need right now.**

### Bad Temp Check Responses (Need Clarification)

- "Sounds good"
- "It makes sense"
- "I feel alright"
- "I'm interested"

**Your response to any of these:**
> "Well of course you're interested (or whatever they said) haha, but do you feel like it's exactly what you need?"

**⚠️ GET. A. NUMBER. DON'T MOVE FORWARD OTHERWISE.**

---

## PART 12: The Close

**BE CALM. BE IN A SLOW TONE OF VOICE. SOUND 100% CONFIDENT. YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY.**

> "So the investment for the community, all the content, the mentorship calls and our guarantee to get to where you've told me today you really want to go is just $3,500."

**⚠️ SILENCE - do not cave in. You must remain silent. Only answer if they have a question.**

### Buying Signals to Listen For

- "What's the next step?"
- "Okay, well what's next?"
- "Okay how do we get started?"
- "Okay let's do it!"

### When They're Ready

> "Awesome! We can get started right now… Are you excited? Ready to get your confidence back??"

**Then SILENCE —**

Take their payment if they're ready.

---

## Objection Handling

### The Core Principle: Use Their Own Words

**The most powerful objection handling is calling back to what THEY said during discovery and the NOW tie-down.**

During the call, write down:
- Their pain (why they're stuck)
- Their dream (what they want)
- Their timeline (when they want it)
- Their NOW commitment ("Yes, I'm ready to work on this now")
- Their temp check number (8, 9, 10)

**When they object after you've solved their stated concern, call it out:**

> "You said [X] was the only thing stopping you. I just solved that. What's REALLY stopping you?"

> "20 minutes ago you told me [exact quote]. What changed?"

> "You rated this a [number]/10. You said this is exactly what you need. Help me understand what's holding you back."

---

### Testing Objections (The Key Move)

**Pattern to recognize:**
1. They state an objection ("money is the issue")
2. You solve it (offer payment plan)
3. They STILL don't commit
4. **This is where you call it out**

> "You said money was the only thing. I just gave you a payment plan. So what's the REAL issue?"

**If you don't test, you'll never find the real objection.**

---

### Example Responses by Objection Type

*Note: These are EXAMPLES. The primary response should always be a callback to their own words from discovery.*

---

#### Spouse Objection

**First, use their words:**
> "Earlier you said this was your decision to make. Has that changed?"

**Example responses:**
- "Totally fair. Quick thing. Is your spouse usually weighing in on business investments, or are you looking for permission to make a decision you already know you need to make?"
- "How does your spouse feel about you getting help with XYZ?"
- "How do you think they'll feel about you getting into a better role?"

---

#### Price Objection

**First, use their words:**
> "You told me you've been stuck for [X months/years]. You said you don't want to be fixing printers in 20 years. What's that costing you?"

**Example responses:**
- "When you say 'it's a lot', do you mean it's a lot compared to the value, or a lot compared to the money sitting in your accounts right now?"

---

#### Upfront Money Objection

**First, use their words:**
> "You said you're ready NOW. Let's figure out how to make it work."

**Example responses:**
- "That is why we split it if that works for you. First payment locks the price. Second payment when cash flow hits."

---

#### Payment Plan Objection

**First, use their words:**
> "You rated this a 9/10. You said it's exactly what you need. If we can make the numbers work, are you in?"

**Example responses:**
- "Why are you looking for a payment plan instead of an upfront commitment?"
- "If you're open to an honest conversation about your finances, we can see how we can make this work."

*Questions to ask:*
- How much do they have in their bank?
- How much do they earn and expect to get when?

*Try to get as much as you can. No less than the payment options in the pricing sheet.*

---

#### Value Objection

**First, use their words:**
> "You said you've been trying to figure this out for [X months]. You said you're overwhelmed and don't know where to start. How much longer do you want to stay stuck?"

**Example responses:**
- "Help me understand. If this gets you your next job even one month sooner - does it pay for itself or not? And what about all the months and years after that?"

---

#### No Time Objection

**First, use their words:**
> "You said this is a NOW thing for you. You said you're ready. The time issue doesn't go away - you either make time or you don't."

**Example responses:**
- "You do not need time today. You need the commitment today. The work starts when your life calms down. The price does not wait for that."
- "Can you carve out 5-10 hours per week?"

---

#### Need to Think About It

**First, use their words:**
> "You said you're ready NOW. You said this is exactly what you need. You gave it a [X]/10. What specifically do you need to think about?"

**Example responses:**
- "Thinking is not the problem. Waiting is. Has waiting moved you closer to your goal or further from it?"
- "What is it that you really feel like you need to think about?"

---

#### January Stall

**First, use their words:**
> "You said you don't want to waste any more time. January is 6 weeks away. That's 6 more weeks of staying stuck."

**Example responses:**
- "January is not a plan. It is a feeling. The only thing that changes in January is the price. You lock the rate now, you start in January. Simple."

---

#### Fear of Failure

**First, use their words:**
> "You told me what you've been doing isn't working. You said you need structure and accountability. This IS the change."

**Example responses:**
- "The only way to fail is to keep the same approach that got you stuck. Change the inputs, change the outputs."
- "Is there anything making you feel like this wouldn't work for you?"

---

#### Want to Shop Around

**First, use their words:**
> "You said this is exactly what you need. You said 9/10. What are you looking for that you didn't see here?"

**Example responses:**
- "Absolutely. Before you spend weeks comparing, let me ask you one thing. Is anyone else offering you a path that pays for itself? If not, what exactly are you comparing?"
- "Is there anything missing from what we've talked about today that makes you feel like you need to find another option?"

---

### The Bottom Line

**Write down their exact words during discovery. Use them in the close.**

| What They Said | When to Use It |
|----------------|----------------|
| "I'm ready NOW" | When they stall |
| "This is exactly what I need" | When they hesitate |
| "9/10" or "10/10" | When they raise objections |
| "Money is the only thing" | After you solve it and they still hesitate |
| "I don't want to be doing this in 20 years" | When they delay |
| Their specific pain | When they lose urgency |

**If you solve their stated objection and they STILL don't commit, call it out:**

> "I just solved [X]. What's REALLY stopping you?"
